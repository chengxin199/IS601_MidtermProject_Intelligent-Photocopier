## Learning Path
1. **Introduction to JavaScript**: Get familiar with the language and its importance in web development.
2. **Syntax and Data Types**: Learn about variables, data types, and how to structure your code.
3. **Control Structures**: Understand how to use loops and conditionals to control the flow of your program.
4. **Functions and Scope**: Dive into function declarations, expressions, and the concept of scope.
5. **Object-Oriented Programming**: Explore objects, prototypes, and inheritance in JavaScript.
6. **DOM Manipulation**: Learn how to interact with and manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript.
7. **Event Handling**: Understand how to handle user events like clicks and key presses.
8. **Asynchronous Programming**: Get introduced to callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax.
9. **Practical Projects**: Build real-world applications to solidify your understanding.

## Assessment Criteria
- Completion of coding exercises with at least 80% accuracy.
- Successful implementation of a project demonstrating learned concepts.
- Participation in discussions and Q&A sessions.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- 😕 Neglecting to properly understand scoping rules which can lead to bugs.
- 🔄 Overcomplicating code with unnecessary loops and conditionals.
- 🐞 Forgetting to handle asynchronous code correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior.
- 📉 Skipping the practice exercises that reinforce the material learned.

## Reflection Questions
- What was the most challenging concept you faced while learning JavaScript?
- How does JavaScript enhance user interaction on web pages compared to static HTML/CSS?
- In what ways do you envision using JavaScript in your future projects?
