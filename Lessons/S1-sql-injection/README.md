## Learning Path
1. **Introduction to SQL Basics** - Familiarize yourself with SQL syntax and database operations.
2. **Understanding SQL Injection** - Learn what SQL injection is and how it works.
3. **Exploring Types of SQL Injection** - Understand various forms of SQL injection attacks.
4. **Identifying Vulnerabilities** - Discover how to find SQL injection flaws in applications.
5. **Exploiting SQL Injection** - Practice using tools to exploit vulnerabilities (in a controlled environment).
6. **Mitigation Strategies** - Learn ways to protect applications against SQL injection attacks.
7. **Real-World Application** - Work on projects that implement your knowledge practically.
8. **Assessment** - Complete quizzes and a final project to test your understanding.

## Assessment Criteria
- Participation in practical exercises
- Completion of quizzes and assessments
- Successful implementation of a final project demonstrating SQL injection prevention strategies

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Ignoring input validation and sanitization
- Overlooking error messages that expose database structure
- Neglecting to update and patch database systems regularly
- Focusing solely on theoretical knowledge without practical application

## Reflection Questions
- What are the most common types of SQL injection attacks you encountered?
- How can understanding SQL injection improve your programming practices?
- What measures will you implement in your projects to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities?
