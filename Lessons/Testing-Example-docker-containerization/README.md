## Learning Path
1. **Introduction to Docker**: Understand the basics of Docker and its advantages over traditional virtualization.
2. **Creating Dockerfiles**: Learn the core syntax and commands used to create effective Dockerfiles.
3. **Implementing Multi-Stage Builds**: Discover how to reduce image size and improve build efficiency using multi-stage builds.
4. **Security Best Practices**: Explore common vulnerabilities and learn how to secure your containers.
5. **Optimizing Images**: Techniques to reduce image size and optimize build times for better performance.
6. **Container Orchestration Basics**: Get an overview of how to manage multiple containers using Docker Compose.

## Assessment Criteria
Your understanding will be evaluated through:
- Hands-on exercises with Dockerfiles.
- A mini-project implementing multi-stage builds.
- A quiz covering security best practices and optimization techniques.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Neglecting Layer Caching**: Failing to optimize the order of commands in Dockerfiles can lead to unnecessary rebuilds.
- **Ignoring Security**: Not implementing security best practices can expose your applications to vulnerabilities.
- **Large Images**: Forgetting to clean up unused dependencies and files can result in bloated images.

## Reflection Questions
- What challenges did you face while creating Dockerfiles?
- How did multi-stage builds impact your deployment process?
- In what ways can you ensure the security of your containers in a production environment?
