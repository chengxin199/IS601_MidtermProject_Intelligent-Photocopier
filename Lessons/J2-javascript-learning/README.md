2. **Set Up Environment**: Install necessary tools and configure your coding environment.
3. **Deep Dive into Syntax**: Understand the basic syntax and structure of JavaScript.
4. **Explore Control Structures**: Learn about conditionals and loops for flow control.
5. **Functions and Scope**: Grasp the concepts of functions and variable scope.
6. **Working with Objects and Arrays**: Manipulate complex data structures effectively.
7. **DOM Manipulation**: Learn how to interact with HTML elements using JavaScript.
8. **Implement Event Handling**: Add interactivity to your web pages.
9. **Understand Asynchronous JavaScript**: Dive into the world of callbacks and promises.
10. **Build a Final Project**: Apply everything you've learned in a practical project.

## Assessment Criteria
- Completion of all exercises and projects.
- Quality and functionality of the final project.
