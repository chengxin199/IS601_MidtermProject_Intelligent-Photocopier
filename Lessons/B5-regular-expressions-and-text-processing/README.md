### Learning Path
1. **Introduction to Regular Expressions:** Familiarize yourself with the basics of regex and its significance in text processing.
2. **Deep Dive into the `re` Module:** Explore the core functionalities and methods available in Python's `re` module.
3. **Hands-on with Patterns and Groups:** Practice creating and using patterns, groups, and named groups.
4. **Experiment with Flags:** Learn how to adjust regex behavior using flags for case sensitivity and more.
5. **Compile vs Inline:** Test performance differences between pre-compiled and inline regex expressions.
6. **Data Validation and Extraction:** Implement regex to validate formats and extract data.
7. **Avoiding Performance Pitfalls:** Understand the common performance issues and techniques to avoid them.
8. **Structured Parsers vs Regex:** Analyze scenarios where structured parsers are more suitable than regex.

### Assessment Criteria
- Participation in exercises and quizzes.
- Completion of a final project demonstrating skills learned.
- Ability to effectively explain regex concepts and applications.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Ignoring performance implications of complex regex patterns.
- Overusing regex for tasks better suited for structured parsers (e.g., JSON, XML).
- Forgetting to escape special characters in patterns.
- Not validating user input properly, leading to security vulnerabilities.

### Reflection Questions
- How can regular expressions improve your text processing tasks?
- In what scenarios have you found regex particularly useful or challenging?
- What strategies have you implemented to avoid performance issues with regex?
