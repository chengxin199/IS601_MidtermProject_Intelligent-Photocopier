## Learning Path
1. **Introduction to System Design:** Familiarize yourself with the course structure and objectives.
2. **Requirements Gathering:** Engage in exercises to practice gathering and analyzing system requirements.
3. **Design Principles:** Explore architectural patterns and principles to guide your design process.
4. **Modeling Techniques:** Learn to use UML and ERD for system modeling through provided resources.
5. **Performance Considerations:** Understand the importance of scalability and performance in system design.
6. **Case Studies:** Analyze real-world case studies to see principles in action.
7. **Final Project:** Apply your knowledge to a real-world project, following the guidelines provided.

## Assessment Criteria
- Completion of exercises and hands-on projects.
- Quality and creativity of the final project submission.
- Participation in discussions and engagement with course materials.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- 🚫 Overlooking requirement gathering; clear requirements are critical for success.
- 🚫 Focusing too much on technology instead of solving business problems.
- 🚫 Neglecting to consider scalability and performance early in the design phase.

## Reflection Questions
- 🤔 What are the key lessons learned from the case studies?
- 🤔 How do you prioritize features when gathering requirements?
- 🤔 What design principles do you find most valuable in your projects?
