## 🚀 Learning Path

1. **Start with JavaScript basics:** Understand syntax, variables, data types, and functions.  
2. **Explore scope and closures:** Grasp how JavaScript handles variable visibility and lifetime.  
3. **Dive into DOM manipulation:** Learn to interact with HTML elements dynamically.  
4. **Implement event handling:** Create responsive pages by listening to user actions.  
5. **Master asynchronous programming:** Work with Promises and async/await for smooth operations.  
6. **Practice error handling:** Debug effectively and write resilient code.  
7. **Build your final project:** Combine concepts to create a functional, interactive web app.

## 📊 Assessment Criteria

Your understanding will be assessed based on:  
- Accuracy and clarity in applying JavaScript syntax and concepts  
- Ability to manipulate the DOM and handle events correctly  
- Effective implementation of asynchronous code with proper error handling  
- Completion and functionality of the final project demonstrating practical skill application  

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Confusing `var`, `let`, and `const` — understand their scope differences  
- Forgetting to handle asynchronous errors, leading to uncaught exceptions  
- Manipulating the DOM before it is fully loaded  
- Overusing global variables causing unexpected behavior  
- Ignoring browser console errors and warnings during development  

---

## 🤔 Reflection Questions

- How does JavaScript’s handling of scope differ from Python?  
- What are the benefits of using promises over traditional callbacks?  
- In what scenarios would async/await improve code readability?  
- How can DOM manipulation improve user experience in web applications?  
- What strategies can you use to debug complex JavaScript applications?
