### Learning Path
1. 📖 Familiarize yourself with the course structure and materials.
2. 🔍 Dive into reading documentation and understanding library capabilities.
3. 🔢 Learn about semantic versioning and its importance in library selection.
4. ⚙️ Explore constraints and markers for effective library management.
5. 🌐 Understand and apply Minimal APIs to maintain clean architecture.
6. 🔧 Study the adapter pattern to prevent tight coupling with third-party libraries.
7. 🚨 Learn how to handle deprecations and identify alternatives.
8. 🔒 Conduct basic security scans on the libraries you plan to use.
9. 🌟 Identify specific features in your application that can benefit from third-party libraries.
10. ✅ Select and justify your choice of libraries for your projects.

### Assessment Criteria
- Participation in quizzes and discussions.
- Completion of practical examples and exercises.
- Quality and justification of library selection in your final project.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ⚠️ Ignoring the documentation, leading to misuse of libraries.
- ⚠️ Over-relying on third-party libraries, resulting in tight coupling.
- ⚠️ Failing to check for security vulnerabilities in libraries.
- ⚠️ Not considering the library's maintenance and community support.
- ⚠️ Neglecting to handle deprecations in a timely manner.

### Reflection Questions
1. 💭 How can library documentation improve your development workflow?
2. 💭 What factors do you consider most important when selecting a third-party library?
3. 💭 How can using an adapter pattern prevent issues in future code maintenance?
4. 💭 What library have you integrated into your projects, and what challenges did you face?
5. 💭 In what scenarios would you avoid using a third-party library altogether?
