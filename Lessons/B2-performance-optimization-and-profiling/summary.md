## üîç Common Pitfalls Avoided
- Overlooking the importance of profiling before optimization, leading to unnecessary changes.
- Ignoring the trade-offs between time and space complexity when selecting data structures.
- Misusing caching techniques, which can lead to stale data or increased memory usage if not properly managed.
- Failing to test concurrent code thoroughly, which can introduce hard-to-detect bugs like race conditions.
- Neglecting to validate performance improvements with benchmarks, leading to false assumptions about efficacy.

## üìà Quality Metrics Improved
- Average execution time reduced by at least 30% through optimized algorithms.
- Memory usage decreased by 20% after implementing effective memory management strategies.
- Reduction in function call times by 50% through caching techniques.
