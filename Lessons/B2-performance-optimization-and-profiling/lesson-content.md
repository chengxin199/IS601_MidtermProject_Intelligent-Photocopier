## Module 1: Introduction and Fundamentals

### Learning Goals
- Understand the importance of performance optimization.
- Familiarize with common performance metrics.
- Learn how to measure performance.

### Theoretical Explanations
Performance optimization is crucial for delivering high-quality software. It involves improving the speed and efficiency of an application. Key performance metrics include:

- **Latency**: Time taken to process a single request.
- **Throughput**: Number of requests processed in a given time.
- **Resource Utilization**: How effectively system resources (CPU, memory) are used.

### Code Example
Here's a simple example of measuring execution time in Python:

```python
import time

def some_function():
    # Simulating a time-consuming task
    time.sleep(2)

start_time = time.time()
some_function()
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

### Practical Exercise
1. Write a function that simulates a task (e.g., a loop that counts to a million) and measure its execution time.
2. Experiment with different tasks and record their execution times.

### Real-World Applications
Understanding performance metrics helps in optimizing web applications, data processing pipelines, and real-time systems.

## Module 2: Core Concepts and Theory

### Learning Goals
- Identify performance bottlenecks using profiling tools.
- Understand algorithm complexity.

### Theoretical Explanations
Profiling involves analyzing an application to determine where time and resources are being spent. Common profiling tools include:

- **cProfile**: A built-in Python profiler.
- **line_profiler**: For line-by-line profiling.
- **memory_profiler**: For memory usage profiling.

### Code Example
Using `cProfile` to profile a function:

```python
import cProfile

def compute_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return compute_fibonacci(n - 1) + compute_fibonacci(n - 2)

cProfile.run('compute_fibonacci(30)')
```

### Practical Exercise
1. Profile a function of your choice using `cProfile`.
2. Analyze the output to identify bottlenecks.

### Real-World Applications
Profiling is essential in optimizing web servers, data analysis tools, and machine learning models.

## Module 3: Practical Implementation

### Learning Goals
- Implement optimizations using efficient algorithms and data structures.
- Apply caching techniques.

### Theoretical Explanations
Choosing the right algorithm and data structure is vital for performance. Common data structures include:

- **Lists**: Good for ordered collections.
- **Sets**: Fast membership testing.
- **Dictionaries**: Efficient key-value storage.

### Code Example
Optimizing a function with memoization:

```python
def memoize(func):
    cache = {}
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args not in cache:
            cache[args] = func(*args)
        return cache[args]
    return wrapper

@memoize
def compute_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return compute_fibonacci(n - 1) + compute_fibonacci(n - 2)

print(compute_fibonacci(30))
```

### Practical Exercise
1. Implement a memoization decorator for a function of your choice.
2. Compare the performance of the memoized function with the non-memoized version.

### Real-World Applications
Caching is widely used in web applications to speed up database queries and API calls.

## Module 4: Advanced Techniques

### Learning Goals
- Understand parallel processing and asynchronous programming.
- Implement techniques for concurrent execution.

### Theoretical Explanations
Parallel processing allows multiple computations to occur simultaneously, while asynchronous programming enables non-blocking operations.

- **Threading**: Useful for I/O-bound tasks.
- **Multiprocessing**: Useful for CPU-bound tasks.
- **Asyncio**: For writing concurrent code using `async` and `await`.

### Code Example
Using `concurrent.futures` for parallel processing:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import time

def task(n):
    time.sleep(n)
    return n

with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(task, i) for i in [1, 2, 3, 4]]
    for future in futures:
        print(f"Task completed with result: {future.result()}")
```

### Practical Exercise
1. Modify the above code to use `ProcessPoolExecutor` instead of `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
2. Measure the time taken for both implementations and analyze the results.

### Real-World Applications
Parallel processing is beneficial in data processing, image processing, and simulations.

## Module 5: Best Practices and Patterns

### Learning Goals
- Learn best practices for optimizing performance.
- Understand common pitfalls in optimization.

### Theoretical Explanations
Best practices include:

- **Avoid premature optimization**: Focus on clarity first, then optimize.
- **Use profiling tools regularly**: Identify bottlenecks as code evolves.
- **Optimize critical paths**: Focus on parts of the code that impact performance the most.

### Code Example
Common pitfalls in performance optimization:

```python
# Using a list when a set is more appropriate
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
if 3 in my_list:  # O(n) time complexity
    print("Found!")

# Using a set instead
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
if 3 in my_set:  # O(1) time complexity
    print("Found!")
```

### Practical Exercise
1. Review a piece of code you have written and identify potential optimizations based on best practices.
2. Refactor the code to implement those optimizations.

### Real-World Applications
Applying best practices ensures that software remains maintainable while achieving optimal performance.
