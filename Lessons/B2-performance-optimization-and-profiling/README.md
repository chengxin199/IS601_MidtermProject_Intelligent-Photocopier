## Assessment Criteria
- Completion of practical exercises and coding challenges.
- Participation in discussions and peer code reviews.
- Submission of a final project demonstrating performance optimization techniques.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Ignoring the significance of profiling before optimization.
- Over-optimizing code prematurely without real bottleneck analysis.
- Neglecting to test and validate performance improvements.
- Failing to understand the trade-offs between readability and performance.

---

## Reflection Questions
- What are the most common performance bottlenecks you've encountered in your projects?
- How did your understanding of algorithms and data structures influence your optimization decisions?
- In what scenarios would you choose caching over memoization, and vice versa?
- How can you apply what you've learned in this course to future projects?
