## Learning Path
1. Familiarize yourself with the course structure and objectives.
2. Start with the introduction to design patterns and their importance.
3. Delve into creational patterns, focusing on the Builder and Factory Method patterns.
4. Explore Singleton and Abstract Factory patterns for object creation.
5. Understand structural patterns, with emphasis on Composite and Prototype patterns.
6. Apply your knowledge through real-world case studies and best practices.

## Assessment Criteria
- Completion of coding exercises and examples.
- Participation in discussion forums and peer reviews.
- Successful implementation of a project using at least two design patterns.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- 💭 Overcomplicating solutions: Keep designs as simple as possible.
- ⚠️ Ignoring best practices: Always adhere to principles of clean code.
- ❌ Failing to document your patterns: Clear documentation enhances understanding.

## Reflection Questions
- What design patterns have you previously used, and how did they benefit your projects?
- Which design pattern do you think is most versatile for Python applications?
- How can you apply the concepts learned in this course to your current or future projects?
