- Relying solely on automated tools without understanding the underlying techniques  
- Ignoring time delays or error-based feedback signals in blind SQL injection  
- Underestimating the complexity of stored procedures and triggers  
- Failing to properly document and analyze test results for remediation  

---

## 🤔 Reflection Questions

- How do advanced SQL injection techniques differ from basic ones in terms of complexity and detection?  
- What are the limitations of automated tools, and when should manual testing be preferred?  
- How can understanding database-specific features help in crafting effective injection payloads?  
- What practices can you implement in your code to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities proactively?  
- How would you explain the importance of ethical considerations when performing penetration testing?
